Air Quality Monitoring and Alert System

The Air Quality Monitoring and Alert System is an IoT-based project designed to detect and alert users about harmful air conditions in real time. Built using Arduino, NodeMCU, and the MQ-135 gas sensor, it measures pollutant levels and displays live AQI data on an LCD screen. When air quality drops below safe levels, a buzzer triggers immediate alerts for safety. The system also uploads data to ThingSpeak Cloud for storage, visualization, and analysis. This project promotes environmental awareness and safety by helping users track and respond to air pollution effectively.

​

🧩 Problem Statement
With the increasing levels of air pollution and the growing risk of gas leaks in industrial and domestic spaces, people often remain unaware of the air quality around them until it becomes harmful. This lack of real-time awareness can lead to severe health issues and safety hazards. Hence, there’s a need for an affordable and connected system that not only monitors air quality but also raises alerts and logs data for further analysis.

​

🎯 Purpose of the Project
The goal of this project is to design and develop an IoT-based Air Quality Monitoring and Alert System using Arduino, NodeMCU, and ThingSpeak. The system measures air quality in real time and alerts users when pollutant levels exceed safe limits. It also stores sensor data on the cloud for long-term monitoring and analysis, helping users visualize pollution trends and take informed actions.

 

🎯 Objectives
To continuously monitor air quality using MQ-135 gas sensor.

To raise visual and audible alerts when air quality becomes hazardous.

To display live AQI readings on an LCD screen for easy user interpretation.

To transmit collected data to ThingSpeak Cloud for storage, visualization, and analytics.

To encourage public awareness about pollution levels and environmental health.
